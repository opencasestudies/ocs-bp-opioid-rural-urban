# **Motivation**
*** 


In this case study we will be examining the number of opioid pills (specifically [oxycodone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_epidemic_in_the_United_States) and [hydrocodone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_epidemic_in_the_United_States), as they are the top two abused opioids) shipped to pharmacies and paractitionaers at the county-level around the United States (US) from 2006 to 2014.

This data comes from the [DEA](https://www.dea.gov/) [Automated Reports and Consolidated Ordering System (ARCOS)](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/arcos/retail_drug_summary/) and was released by the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) after legal action by the owner of the [Charleston Gazette-Mail](https://www.wvgazettemail.com/) in West Virginia and the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/).

We will investigate how the number of shipped pills compares for rural and urban counties. This analysis will demonstrate how different regions of the country may have been more at risk for opioid addiction crises due to differing rates of opioid prescription (using the number of pills as a proxy for perscription rates). This will help inform students about how evidence-based intervention decisions are made in this area.  

This case study is motivated by this [article](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6802a1.htm?s_cid=mm6802a1_w):

Mortal. Wkly. Rep. 68, 25–30 (2019). DOI: [10.15585/mmwr.mm6802a1](http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6802a1)

####

This article explores rates of opioid perscriptions in rural and urban communties in the United States using the [Athenahealth electronic health record (EHR) system](https://landing.athenahealth.com/g/improvecare?cmp=10672941&utm_salesforce=7016f000001yWQMAA2&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=1%20Branded%20Experimental&utm_adgroup=ModBroad&utm_source=google&utm_term=%2Bathena%20%2Bhealth&utm_type=b&gclid=Cj0KCQjwtZH7BRDzARIsAGjbK2bn_oxyd0jNBGQkPMcSSpEuGbzLUqL8m-tuAQWMZ-smUNLLjtztB7EaAgSlEALw_wcB) for 31,422 primary care providers from January 2014 to March 2017.

The main takeaways from this article were:

> Among 70,237 fatal drug overdoses in 2017, prescription opioids were involved in 17,029 (24.2%).

> The percentage of patients prescribed an opioid was higher in **rural** than in urban areas. 

> Higher opioid prescribing rates put patients **at risk for addiction and overdose**.


Indeed,  this was confirmed by another [article](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/1874575) which surveyed heroin users.

####

They found that:

> Respondents who began using heroin in the 1960s were predominantly young men (82.8%; mean age, 16.5 years) whose first opioid of abuse was heroin (80%).

> However, more **recent users** were older (mean age, 22.9 years) men and women **living in less urban areas (75.2%)** who were **introduced to opioids through prescription drugs (75.0%)**.

> Heroin use has changed from an inner-city, minority-centered problem to one that has a more widespread geographical distribution, involving **primarily white men and women in their late 20s living outside of large urban areas**.

<b><u> Our main question: </u></b>

 How did opioid shipment rates differ between rural and urban regions over time around the US from 2006-2014?

# **Learning Objectives** 
*** 

In this case study, we will demonstrate how to obtain data from an [Application Programming Interface (API)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API), which is an interface that allows users to more easily interact with a database. We will also especially focus on using packages and functions from the [`Tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/){target="_blank"}, such as `dplyr`, `tidyr`. The tidyverse is a library of packages created by RStudio. While some students may be familiar with previous R programming packages, these packages make data science in R more legible and intuitive.


```{r, out.width = "20%", echo = FALSE, fig.align ="center"}

```

The skills, methods, and concepts that students will be familiar with by the end of this case study are:


Data science skills:  
  
1. Importing data from an [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) (`httr` and `jasonlite`)  
2. How to reshape data by pivoting between "long" and "wide" formats and drop rows with `NA` values (`tidyr`) 
3. How to join data with `dplyr`
4. How to create formatted tables of data with `formattable`
5. How to create data visualizations with `ggplot2` 
6. How to look for missing data in a dataset (`naniar`)


Statistical concepts and methods:  
  
1. Understanding of when and why data normalization is useful
2. Understanding of when and why data transformation is useful
3. How to implement a t-test in R

# **Context**
*** 
**What exactly are opioids?**

According to the [DEA](https://www.dea.gov/taxonomy/term/331) and the [Alta Mira addiction treatment center](https://www.altamirarecovery.com/opiates/difference-opiates-opioids/):

Opioids (also known as narcotics which comes from the Greek word for "stupor"), describes a class of drugs that contain [opium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium) (the poppy plant - [*Papaver somniferum*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papaver_somniferum)), are derived from opium, or contain a semi-synthetic or synthetic substitute for opium.

Hoewver, technically, opioids are substances that bind to the [opioid receptors](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/10/071014163647.htm#:~:text=The%20opioid%20system%20consists%20of,and%20potentially%20initiating%20addictive%20behaviors.) in the body, which are involved in the sensation of `pain` and the experience of [reward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reward_system#:~:text=The%20reward%20system%20is%20a,involve%20pleasure%20as%20a%20core). There are actually opioids that naturally are made by the human body, the most well known being the [endorphins](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320839#:~:text=Endorphins%20are%20chemicals%20produced%20by,surgery%20or%20for%20pain%2Drelief.).


Oppoid drugs tend to be addictive becuase they modulate the [reward system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reward_system#:~:text=The%20reward%20system%20is%20a,involve%20pleasure%20as%20a%20core). This is the part of the brain that reinforces behaviors (normally these are behaviours such as drinking water or eating food) by causing the experience of pleasure (through the release of a neurotransmitter called [dopamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine)). 

This same system can be activated by both opioids that naturally occur in the body, as well as opioid perscription drugs and other addictive drugs. Activation of this sytem by drug use  leads to very high releases of Dopamine and the sensation of pleasure which ultimately leads to reinforced use of that drug.

knitr::include_graphics("https://www.drugabuse.gov/sites/default/files/styles/content_image_large/public/drugstargetthebrainspleasurecenter.gif?itok=Ffd_PCeb")
```

#### [[source]](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugs-brains-behavior-science-addiction/drugs-brain)


In general, opioids medications and drugs have been found to dull the senses, releive pain, supress cough, reduce respiration and heart rate, induce constipation, and induce feelings of euphoria. They have a high potential for abuse and addiction.

Drugs within this class include (with perscription drug brand names are shown in parentheses): 

1) Non-synthetic purified: Morhpine, Codeine, Thebaine
2) Semi-synthetic:  Heroin, Oxycodone (OxyContin, Oxecta, Roxicodone), and Hydrocodone ( Vicodin, Lortab, Lorcet)), oxymorphone (Opana), Hydromorphone (Dilaudid, Exalgo)
3) Synthetic: Meperidine (Demerol), Methadone (Methadose, Dolophine), and Fentanyl (Abstral, Actiq, Fentora, Duragesic, Lazanda, Subsys), Tramadol (ConZip, Ryzolt, Ultram)

```

##### [[source]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Opium_pod_cut_to_demonstrate_fluid_extraction1.jpg)

Opium comes from the fluid (which is also called poppy tears) inside the seed capusules of the [*Papaver somniferum*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papaver_somniferum) plant. This contains morphine, codeine, and thebaine. This is then dried. 

Opium has been used by humans since 5000 BCE and it has been used across the world. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium) for an interesting overview of the history. 


Opium derived medications were historically used in United States to treat a variety of ailments besides pain including: cholera, dysentery, tubuerculosi, and mental illness.  

Of note, they state that "from 1898 to 1910 heroin was marketed as a non-addictive morphine substitute and cough medicine for children"!

Here you can see a photo of a bottle of herion:

```

#### [[source]](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Bayer_Heroin_bottle.jpg/220px-Bayer_Heroin_bottle.jpg)

Opioids have continued to be used in the treatment of pain. 

## The Opioid Epidemic 

The opioid epidemic began in the late 1990s. 

According to the [US department of health and human services (HHS)](
https://www.hhs.gov/opioids/about-the-epidemic/index.html):

> In the late 1990s, pharmaceutical companies reassured the medical community that patients would not become addicted to opioid pain relievers and healthcare providers began to prescribe them at greater rates.

> Increased prescription of opioid medications led to **widespread misuse** of both prescription and non-prescription opioids before it became clear that these medications could indeed be highly addictive.

> In 2017 the [HHS](https://www.hhs.gov) declared a public health emergency 

See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_opioid_epidemic) for a timeline of the epidemic in the US and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_epidemic_in_the_United_States) for more detials about the epidemic.


According to this [article](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6802a1.htm?s_cid=mm6802a1_w) from the [Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR)](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/about.html) of the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention):

> Drug overdose is the **leading cause** of unintentional injury-associated death in the United States.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "Opioids_Infographic.png"))
```

##### [[source]](https://www.hhs.gov/opioids/sites/default/files/2019-11/Opioids%20Infographic_letterSizePDF_10-02-19.pdf)


According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/epidemic/index.html), there were 3 waves of the epidemic:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "2018-3-Wave-Lines-Mortality.png"))

```

#### [[source]](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/images/epidemic/2018-3-Wave-Lines-Mortality.png)

You can see that moth recent overdose deaths were due to the use of synthetic opioids, where as previous high levels of overdoses (till about 2015) were attributable to natural and semi-synthetic opioids (which is what we will look at in this case study). 

They state that: 

> From 1999–2018, almost **450,000** people died from an **overdose involving any opioid**, including prescription and illicit opioids.


Importantly rates appear to differ across states, according to this [CDC report](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm675152e1.htm?s_cid=mm675152e1_w)

```

[[source]](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/figures/mm675152e1-F.gif)


According to the [motivating report](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/pdfs/mm6802a1-H.pdf) for our case study: 

Perscription rates are now declining, however, perscription of opioids was found to be higher in rural areas rather than urban ares.

It is important to identify locations where people are particularly vulernable to target interventions for communities that need it the most.

 
# **Limitations**
*** 
There are some important considerations regarding this data analysis to keep in mind: 

According to the [Washington Post data](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/2019/07/18/how-download-use-dea-pain-pills-database/ about the DEA data:

>"It’s important to remember that the number of pills in each county does not necessarily mean those pills went to people who live in that county. The data only shows us what pharmacies the pills are shipped to and nothing else."

Furthermore, we will define counties as being rural or urban however there can be great variation within a county and we used land area values form only 2010 even though these can fluctuate. Therefore the way we categorized counties should be seen as an approximation.

Finally, overdose deaths are often due to the use of multiple substances. Simply because a county recieved more pills does not  mean that people in that county would experience more drug overdoses. It is also important to remember that perscription opioids only account for a portion of the drug overdose deaths reported in this time period. However, according to this [article](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/1874575) 75% of heroin users surveyed were introduced to opioids through perscription drug use.


# **What are the data?**
*** 

We will use data from two sources:

1) The US census for land area of counties to allow us to extimate county-level population density  

2) The [Washington Post data](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/2019/07/18/how-download-use-dea-pain-pills-database/)from the [Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)](https://www.dea.gov/) about opioid ([oxycodone](https://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/Oxycodone-2020_0.pdf) and [hydrocodone](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drug_chem_info/hydrocodone.pdf)) pill shipments to pharmacies and paractitionaers around the US at the county-level

This dataset was released in July of 2019 and has been controversial as according to the Washington Post:

> The disclosure is part of a civil action brought by 2,500 cities, towns, counties and tribal nations alleging that nearly two dozen drug companies **conspired to saturate the nation with opioids**.

See [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/2019/07/20/opioid-files/?arc404=true) for more details about how this database was released.

The [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/2019/07/18/how-download-use-dea-pain-pills-database/)states that they:

>.. cleaned the data to include only information on shipments of oxycodone and hydrocodone pills. We did not include data on 10 other opioids because they were shipped in much lower quantities...

>It’s important to remember that the number of pills in each county does not necessarily mean those pills went to people who live in that county. The data only shows us what pharmacies the pills are shipped to and nothing else.

This data was part of the [Automated Reports and Consolidated Ordering System (ARCOS)]https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/arcos/retail_drug_summary/ of the DEA in which:

> manufacturers and distributors report their controlled substances transactions

Their [website](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/arcos/index.html#background) indicates that: 


> The Controlled Substances Act of 1970  created the requirement for Manufacturers and Distributors to report their controlled substances transactions to the Attorney General. The Attorney General delegates this authority to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).

> ARCOS is an automated, comprehensive drug reporting system which monitors the flow of DEA controlled substances from their point of manufacture through commercial distribution channels to point of sale or distribution at the dispensing/retail level - hospitals, retail pharmacies, practitioners, mid-level practitioners, and teaching institutions. Included in the list of controlled substance transactions tracked by ARCOS are the following: All Schedules I and II materials (manufacturers and distributors); Schedule III narcotic and gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) materials (manufacturers and distributors); and selected Schedule III and IV psychotropic drugs (manufacturers only).

The annual report about the data from 2019, can be found [here](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/arcos/retail_drug_summary/report_yr_2019.pdf).

As this is a very large dataset, thus the Washington Post created an [application prgoramming interface (API)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API)  to make it easier for users to access the data. 

An API is a computational interface that simplifies interactacts with a data or file system for a user. It is similar to a [Graphical User Interface GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface), yet it allows the user some more flexibility/functionality.

This [link](https://arcos-api.ext.nile.works/__swagger__/) takes you to the Washington Post ARCOS API. 

There was also an R package on cran called [arcos](https://cran.r-project.org/package=arcos) for interacting with the API, but this has been archived.  This package is however still available [here](https://github.com/wpinvestigative/arcos) on Github.

See [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/2019/07/18/how-download-use-dea-pain-pills-database/) for more information about how to get access the Washington Post DEA database.


# **Data Import**
*** 

## Land Area

We will need land area data for our calculations of population density. 

We obtained county land area data from the US census Bureau at this [link](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2011/compendia/usa-counties-2011.html#LND)

This [link](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2011/compendia/usa-counties-2011/file-layout.html) explains how the data is formated.

We will use the `read_excel()` function of the `readxl` package to import the data. We will also convert the data into a [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/) (which is a the tidyverse version of a data frame) by using the `as_tibble()` function of the `tibble` package.

```{r}
land <- readxl::read_excel(here::here("data", "LND01.xls"))
land <- as_tibble(land)
```

We can take a look at the data using the base `head()` function which will show the frist 6 rows.

```{r}
head(land)
```

Looks good!

## Accessing APIs

The `httr` package formats what are called "GET requests" so that they will work properly. This allows for the data to be retrieved from the API.

The `jsonlite` package alows you to convert the data from `JSON` (often used by APIs) to a differet format that is easier to work with.

APIs typically require a password or key to gain access. Thus the `httr` package helps to authenticate your data request. Often these keys are something that you do not want to share, unless the API is public.

In our case the [API](https://arcos-api.ext.nile.works/__swagger__/) is indeed public, and currently "uO4EK6I" is publicly published as a key to use on the [github page](https://github.com/wpinvestigative/arcos) for the `arcos` package. We will use that here to access the API.


## Population Data

We are interested in the county level data - first let's get the population data. We can access it by:

1) Pressing the `GET` button on the API.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "get.png"))

```

2) Pressing the "Try it out" button.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "tryitout.png"))
```

3) Entering the key (which we got from [here]([github page](https://github.com/wpinvestigative/arcos))).

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "key.png"))
```

4) Clicking the "Execute" button.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "execute.png"))
```

This gives us the following output:

`curl -X GET "https://arcos-api.ext.nile.works/v1/county_population?key=uO4EK6I" -H  "accept: application/json"`

We can copy the URL section `"https://arcos-api.ext.nile.works/v1/county_population?key=uO4EK6I"` and use it in the `GET()` function of the `httr` package :

```{r}
county_pop_json<-httr::GET(url = "https://arcos-api.ext.nile.works/v1/county_population?key=uO4EK6I")
```

If we needed to specify a username and password, we would do so using the `authenticate()` function of the `httr` package within the `GET` function. The `authenticate()` function takes `user`, `password` and `type` arguments.

Here is an example:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
GET(url = "https://exampleURL", authenticate(user = "username", password = "password", type = "basic"))
```

The default type is `"basic"` and typcally what is needed.

Now that we have used the `GET` function, we have a [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)](https://fileinfo.com/extension/json#:~:text=A%20JSON%20file%20is%20a,web%20application%20and%20a%20server.) file of the data. 

JSON files are [lightweight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_programming_language) meaning that they don't take up much memory and they are human readible files to make transmitting data from websites easier.

```{r}
county_pop_json
```


Here we can see that the object called `countyjson` is a `json` object. You will also see that the `Satus` is `200`, which means that we were sucessful in retreiving the data from the API.

Now we can use the `content()` funtion of the `httr` package to extract the text from the file:

```{r}
county_pop_text <-httr::content(county_pop_json, "text")
```

This will be a very large string at this point, we can take a look at part of it by using the `str_sub()` function of the `stringr` package. In this case we will only look at the first 400 characters.

What is a string or a chracter?

***
<details> <summary> Click here for an explanation about character strings if you are not yet familiar </summary>

There are several classes of data in R programming. 
Character is one of these classes. 
A character string is an individual data value made up of characters. 
This can be a paragraph, like the legend for the table, or it can be a single letter or number like the letter `"a"` or the number `"3"`. 

If data are of class character, than the numeric values will not be processed like a numeric value in a mathematical sense. 

</details>
***

```{r}
stringr::str_sub(county_pop_text, start = 1, end = 400)
```


Now to get the data into a more readible format , we can use the `fromJSON()` function of the `jsonlite` package and again create a tibble of the data using `as_tibble()` 

```{r}
county_pop <- jsonlite::fromJSON(county_pop_text, flatten = TRUE)
county_pop <- as_tibble(county_pop)
```

We can use the `glimpse()` function and the `distinct()` function of the `dplyr` package to get a better sense of the data. The `distinct()` function allows us to take a look at the unique values of the `year` variable.

```{r}
dplyr::glimpse(county_pop)
dplyr::distinct(county_pop,year)
```

It looks like we have the full data from 2006-2014.


```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
write.csv(county_pop, file = here::here("data", "county_pop_arcos.csv"))
save(county_pop, file =  here::here("data", "county_pop_arcos.rda"))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
load(here::here("data", "county_pop_arcos.rda"))
```

We are also interested in opioid pill shipment data at the county level. 



## Annual Shipment Data

Here is the result of the same steps using the API for the combined_county_annual data:

`curl -X GET "https://arcos-api.ext.nile.works/v1/combined_county_annual?key=uO4EK6I" -H  "accept: application/json"`

```{r}

```

Looks like we have the same years of data.


```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# We also retrieved the monthly data for instructors who wish to use this data

save(monthlyDosage, file =  here::here("data", "county_monthly.rda"))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
load(here::here("data", "county_monthly.rda"))
```


# **Data Exploration**
***

Now let's take a deaper look at the data to see if we have any missing data using the `naniar` package.

We can use the `vis_miss()` function to create a plot of missing data.

Let's start with the land area data.
```{r}
naniar:: vis_miss(land)
```
Looks like there is no missing data.

How about the population data:

```{r}
vis_miss(county_pop)
```

We appear to be missing some values for the `Name` and `variable` data, but we don`t intend to use these, so this should be ok. It is however a good idea to check these rows to see if anything strange is happening.

Let's use the `filter()` function of the `dplyr` package and the `is.na()` base function to see more about the data that does not have countyfips codes.

We will also start using the `%>%` pipe of the `magrittr` package for our assignments.


<details> <summary> Click here if you are unfamiliar with piping in R, which uses this `%>%` operator</summary>  


By [piping](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html){target="_blank"} we mean using the `%>%` pipe operator which is accessible after loading the `tidyverse` or several of the packages within the tidyverse like `dplyr` because they load the [`magrittr` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html){target="_blank"}. 
This allows us to perform multiple sequential steps on one data input. 

***

</details> 

```{r}
county_pop %>% filter(is.na(NAME))
```

This looks ok. So let's now move on to the DEA data.
```{r}
vis_miss(annualDosage)
```

Interesting, we appear to be missing `countyfips` codes for a small percentage of our annual data.


Let's take a look at this data:

```{r}
annualDosage %>% filter(is.na(countyfips))
```


It looks like the missing data is data for Puerto Rico - it makes sense that it doesn't have countyfips codes.

Let's see if there is any data other than data for Puerto Rico that is also missing `countyfips` values. We can use the `!=` operator which indicates not equal to.


```{r, eval = FALSE}
annualDosage %>% filter(is.na(countyfips)) %>%
 filter(BUYER_STATE != "PR")
```

#### {.scrollable }
```{r, echo = FALSE}
annualDosage %>% filter(is.na(countyfips)) %>%
 filter(BUYER_STATE != "PR") %>%
  # this allows us to show the full output in the rendered rmarkdown
 print(n = 1e4)
```
####

It looks like there is also data for other territories in the dataset, as well as some counties with no name.

For some reason the rows for the Montgomery county of Arkansa are also missing a `countyfips` value.

```{r}
annualDosage %>% filter(is.na(countyfips)) %>%
 filter(BUYER_STATE == "AR")
```


According to this [website](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/home/?cid=nrcs143_013697) thie fIPS code is 05097.


We will update these values in the next section.


# **Data Wrangling**
***

## Cleaning land data

We want the `LND110210D` column which is the data from the year 2010.

LND = Land Area
110 = unit square miles (subgroup-code of the group) * avocado I found this somehwere else.. the census info was vauge would like to confirm that that is indeed what the sugroup code shows us
2 = century
10 = 2010 (based on the century)
D = Data

Thus we can select just the county names, the county numeric codes, and the `LND110210D`column by using the `select()` function of the `dplyr` package.

```{r}
county_area <- land %>% select(Areaname, STCOU, LND110210D)
county_area
```


## Updating `countyfips`

We will use the `case_when()` function of the `dplyr` package recode the `NA` values for the rows for the `MONGOMERY` county of `AR` to be `05097`. First we need to specify for these particular rows. Becuase there Montgomery may be a county name in other states, we need to evaluate when the `BUYER_STATE` is `AR` and when the `BUYER_COUNTY` is `MONTGOMERY`. We will use the `&` opperator to indcate that both conditions must be true. We will then recode the `coutryfips` values for these rows to be `"05097"` using the `~` symbol. All other values need to stay the same. Thus we need to use `TRUE ~` to recode all the other `countyfips` values to what they currently are. Otherwise these would autmatically be `NA`.

We are also going to use a special pipe operator from the [`magrittr` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html) called the compound assignment pipe-operator or sometimes the double pipe operator. 

This allows us to use the `annualDosage` as our input and reassign it at the end after all the subsequent steps have been performed, although in this case it is only one step.

```{r}

annualDosage %<>% 
  mutate(countyfips = case_when(BUYER_STATE == "AR" & 
                               BUYER_COUNTY == "MONTGOMERY" ~ as.character("05097"),
                               TRUE ~ countyfips))

```

Now we can check that we indeed fixed our data.

```{r}
annualDosage %>% 
  filter(is.na(countyfips)) %>%
  filter(BUYER_STATE == "AR")

annualDosage %>% 
  filter(BUYER_COUNTY == "MONTGOMERY") %>%
  filter(BUYER_STATE == "AR")
```

Great! We fixed it.





OK, we also had some rows that didn't have county names because they were just missing or the data was for US territories. We will remove the values that dont have county names.

First let's take a look at them agian.

```{r}
annualDosage %>% filter(is.na(BUYER_COUNTY))
```

We can filter out these values by using the `!` exclamation mark before the `is.na()` function.

```{r}

annualDosage %<>%  filter(!is.na(BUYER_COUNTY))
```

And now let's check that these `NA` values are gone:

```{r}
annualDosage %>% filter(is.na(BUYER_COUNTY))

```

Let's check if our land area data has information for US territories. If not, we will remove the data for the territories in our `annualDosage` data. However, this would be very interesting and imporatant to investigate. We can use the `str_detect()` function of the `stringr` package, which contains lots of functions for looking for patterns in character strings, to look for data from Puerto Rico. 

The `str_detect()` function allows us to look for a particular pattern. It does not have to be the full value, there can be a partial match. Thus we can look to see if there are any `PR` strings withing the vlaues of the the `Areaname` variable. 

```{r}
county_area %>% filter(str_detect(string = Areaname, pattern = "PR"))
```

You can see using a different abbreviation, that this code does as intended:

```{r}
county_area %>% filter(str_detect(string = Areaname, pattern = "AR"))
```

OK, so it does mot look like there is any territory land area data in this dataset. Thus we will also remove these from the `annualDosage` and `monthlyDosage` tibbles.

## Rural and Urban Counties

Defining if a region is rural or urban is actually quite complicated as the overall population changes, the structure of our towns and cities changes, and the access between different locations changes over time. Please see this [report](https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/reference/ua/Defining_Rural.pdf) form the US Census Beureau about the history of this definition. 

According to several [definitions](https://www.hrsa.gov/rural-health/about-us/definition/index.html) - urban **areas** are often defined as those with greater than 50,000 people. However, there are also
[definitions](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/rural-economy-population/rural-classifications/what-is-rural/) of rural areas being based on  "population densities of less than 500 people per square mile and places with fewer than 2,500 people". Typically counties are made up of multiple areas. 

The census estimates rural and urban areas around the US relatively often. However, census collections about these measuresments does not occur every year.

Thus we will define a county as rural or urban based on the population density using the USDA [definition]((https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/rural-economy-population/rural-classifications/what-is-rural/)) that we described above:

rural  = population densities of less than 500 people per square mile, as well as places with fewer than 2,500 people   
  uban = populations densities of greater than 500 people per square mile


Ideally we would want land area from each year, as these do fluctuate a bit, however, this should be a decent approximation as 2010 is in the middle of our time span.

We will therefore calculate the density as the number of people per square mile by dividing the population values by the land area values. To do so we first need to combine our `county_area` and our `county_pop` data together. First we want to make sure that we have one column, in our case the  column that contains the numeric code for the counties, in the same format and with the same name in both the tibbles that we wish to combine. 

We can use the `rename()` function of the `dplyr` package to rename the `STCOU` column to be `countyfips`. The new name is always listed first before the old name with this function like so: `rename(new_name = old_name)`.

```{r}
county_area %<>%
  rename(countyfips = STCOU)
```


We can use the `mutate()` funtion of the `dplyr` package to make the `countyfips` variable a factor in both tibbles. 

What exactly is a factor?

***
<details> <summary> Click here for an explanation of data classes in R </summary>

There are several classes of data in R programming. 
Character is one of these classes. 
A character string is an individual data value made up of characters. 
This can be a paragraph, like the legend for the table, or it can be a single letter or number like the letter `"a"` or the number `"3"`. 

If data are of class character, than the numeric values will not be processed like a numeric value in a mathematical sense. 

If you want your numeric values to be interpreted that way, they need to be converted to a numeric class. 
The options typically used are integer (which has no decimal place) and double precision (which has a decimal place). 

A variable that is a [factor](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~s133/factors.html#:~:text=Conceptually%2C%20factors%20are%20variables%20in,refered%20to%20as%20categorical%20variables.&text=Factors%20in%20R%20are%20stored,when%20the%20factor%20is%20displayed.) has a set of particular values called levels. Even if these are numeric, they will be interpreted as level not as a mathematical numnber. You can modify the order of these levels with the `forcats` package.

</details>


***


```{r}
county_pop %<>%
  mutate(countyfips = as.factor(countyfips))

county_area %<>%
  mutate(countyfips = as.factor(countyfips))
```

Great! Now we are ready to combine our data together.

We can do so using one of the  `*_join()`functions of the `dplyr` package.

There are several ways to join data using the `dplyr` package.


```{r, echo = FALSE, outwidth = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "join.png"))
```

##### [[source]](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/join.html)

Here is  a visualization of these options:

```{r, echo = FALSE, outwidth = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "join_image.png"))
```

##### [[source]](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)

See [here](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/join.html) for more details about joining data.

Since the population data came from the API, we probably have information about opioid pill shipments for each of the included counties. Since the land area data came from a different source, it may contain additional counties that are not in our population or drug shipment data.  Thus we will use the `left_join()` function where x in this case will be the `county_pop`  and y will be the `country_area`. Thus we will add the `LND110210D` (land area) values for all counties that match `county_pop` based on the `countyfips` column that they have in common. 


```{r}
county_info <-left_join(county_pop, county_area)
```

We are now ready to calculate the population density per square mile. We can create a new column with this data using the `mutate()` function and the `/` to divide the `population` value by the land area value (in square miles) for each county. Let's also make the `year` variable a factor.

```{r}
county_info %<>%
  mutate(density = population/LND110210D,
         year = as.factor(year))

glimpse(county_info)
```


Great, now we are ready to create a variable that classifies if a county was rural or urban based on our definition of rural counties being those with less than 500 people per square mile as well as those with less than 2,500 people. We will use the `case_when()` function of the `dplyr` package to calssify the new `rural_urban` variable as either `"Urban"` or `"Rural"` based on the evaluations of the `density` and the `population` variables. If the density is greater than or equal to 500 people per square mile, then the county will be coded as `"Urban"`, alternatively if the density is less than 500 people per square mile or the population is less than 2500, than the county will be coded as `"Rural"`. The `|` opperator is used to indicate that either expression should result in coding the county as `"Rural"`

```{r}

county_info %<>%
  mutate(rural_urban = case_when(density  >= 500 ~ "Urban",
                                 density  < 500 | population < 2500 ~ "Rural"))
```

We can use the `count()` function of the `dplyr` package to see how many of each this resulted in:

```{r}
count(county_info, rural_urban)
```

We will now combine the `annualDosage` data with the `count_info` tibble.

#### {.think_question_block}
<b><u> Question Opportunity </u></b>

How might we do this?

####


<details> <summary> Click here to reveal the code. </summary>

```{r}
annualDosage %<>%
  mutate(countyfips = as.factor(countyfips),
                  year = as.factor(year))
  
Annual <-left_join(annualDosage, county_info)

```
</details>

```{r}
glimpse(Annual)
```

Great, now we should have the data that we need for the case study. 

```{r,echo= FALSE, eval = TRUE}
write.csv(Annual, file = here::here("data","Wrangled", "Annual_opioid_data.csv"))
save(Annual, file =  here::here("data","Wrangled", "Annual_opioid_data.rda"))
```

Notice how there is a variable called `DOSAGE_UNIT`. This indicates the number of pills shipped to a pharmacy in this county that were either [oxycodone](https://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/Oxycodone-2020_0.pdf) or [hydrocodone](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drug_chem_info/hydrocodone.pdf).

Let's do a check to see how complete our data is now that we have combined our `country_info` data with the `monthlyDosage` and `annualDosage` data. We will have NA values for any counties present in the DAE data but not in our land area data. We can use the `vis_miss()` function `naniar` package to create a plot that shows if we have any missing data.

```{r}
naniar:: gg_miss_var(Annual)
```

#### {.scrollable }

```{r}
Annual %>%
  filter(is.na(STATE))
```
####

There does not appear to be land area and/or population data for these counties.
```{r}
county_info %>% filter(countyfips == "01001")
county_info %>% filter(countyfips == "05097")
county_info %>% filter(countyfips == "02201")
county_info %>% filter(countyfips == "02280")

# there is land data for this county but thats all
land %>% filter(STCOU == "05097")

county_pop %>% filter(countyfips == "05097")

# **Data Analysis and Visualization**
***

### How has population density changed over the years in different states?


```{r}
dens_df <- county_info  %>% group_by(BUYER_STATE, year) %>%
     summarise( mean_DENS = mean(density, na.rm = TRUE))

 ggplot(dens_df, aes(x =BUYER_STATE, y = mean_DENS, col=year, group = year)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),
          axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```

We can see that the density is fairly similar for most states, however DC, MA, NJ, NY, RI, and VA have much higher densities. We also see that DC shows the largest change over time.


```{r}

 ggplot(dens_df, aes(x =year, y = log(mean_DENS), col=year, group = year)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  geom_jitter(width = .1) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),
        legend.position = "none") +
  labs(y = "Log state mean population density")

```



```{r}

dens_df <- county_info  %>% group_by( year) %>%
     summarise( mean_DENS = mean(density, na.rm = TRUE))

 ggplot(dens_df, aes(x =year, y = mean_DENS)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank()) +
  labs(y = "US mean population density")
```

The density doesn't appear to change that much from 2006 to 2014. 

How does this compare with raw population values?

```{r}

dens_df <- county_info  %>% group_by( year) %>%
     summarise( total_population = sum(population, na.rm = TRUE))

 ggplot(dens_df, aes(x =year, y = total_population)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank()) +
  labs(y = "US total population")
 
```


### How have the number of rural and urban areas changed over years?

```{r}

R_U <- county_info  %>% group_by( year) %>%
     count(rural_urban)

 ggplot(R_U, aes(x = year, y = n, col = rural_urban, group = rural_urban)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~rural_urban, scales = "free") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90),
        legend.title = element_blank())
```

It looks as though the number of urban areas has increased, while the number of rural areas has decreased over time.


```{r}
R_U <- county_info  %>% group_by( year) %>%
     count(rural_urban)
R_U %<>% pivot_wider( names_from = rural_urban, values_from = n)
R_U %<>% ungroup() %>% 
  mutate("Rural Change" = Rural - lag(Rural), 
        "Urban Change"= Urban - lag(Urban),
percent_urban = round(Urban/(Urban +Rural),3)*100)

formattable(R_U, list(`percent_urban` = color_bar("#FA614B")))

formattable(R_U, list(`percent_urban` = color_bar("#FA614B"),
                      `Rural Change` = formatter("span",

In this plot it appearst that the counties in  California  got the largest number of pills shipped. However, since we did not account for population or population density, this could simply be because it is the most populated state. To account for this we will perform something called normalization to make a more fair comparison.


## Normalization of pill count

### Mormalization based on density
```{r}

Annual%<>%  mutate(dens_DOSAGE =  DOSAGE_UNIT/ density)

glimpse(Annual)
```

Why Density Normalization?

![](plot/norm_dens.png)


Description about how we also need log transformation

```{r, fig.height = 7, fig.width=8}
p1 <- ggplot(Annual , aes(x = year, y = DOSAGE_UNIT, colour = year)) + 
  geom_boxplot()+ 
  labs(title = "Without Normalization")+

p2 <- ggplot(Annual, aes(x = year, y = dens_DOSAGE, colour = year)) + 
  geom_boxplot()+ 
  labs(title = "Density Normalization")+
  theme_minimal()

ggarrange(p1, p2, nrow = 2, ncol=2)

```


```{r}

Annual %>% pivot_longer(names_to = "type", 
                        values_to  = "value", 
                        cols = c(DOSAGE_UNIT, 
                                 dens_DOSAGE)) %>%

```

## How rural and urban areas differ for prescription rates. 


The goal of normalization is to make every datapoint have the same 
scale so each feature is equally important. 

```{r}
Annual %>% pivot_longer(names_to = "type", 
                        values_to  = "value", 
                        cols = c(DOSAGE_UNIT, 
                                 dens_DOSAGE ))%>%
  mutate(type = forcats::fct_inorder(type)) %>%

ggplot( aes(y = value, x = year, colour = rural_urban, group = rural_urban)) + 
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean,
               fun.ymin = function(x) mean(x) - sd(x), 
               fun.ymax = function(x) mean(x) + sd(x), 
               geom = "pointrange") +
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean,
               geom = "line") +
  facet_wrap( ~ type, scales = "free") +
  labs(title = "Dosage Change Without Normalization")+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))

```

```{r, fig.width=15, fig.height=8}

p5 <- ggplot(Annual, aes(y = DOSAGE_UNIT, x = year, colour = rural_urban, group = rural_urban)) + 
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean,
               fun.ymin = function(x) mean(x) - sd(x), 
               fun.ymax = function(x) mean(x) + sd(x), 
               geom = "pointrange") +
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean,
               geom = "line") +
  facet_wrap( ~ rural_urban) +
  labs(title = "Dosage Change Without Normalization")+
  theme_minimal()

p6 <- ggplot(Annual , aes(y = dens_DOSAGE, x = year, colour = rural_urban, group = rural_urban)) + 
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean,
               fun.ymin = function(x) mean(x) - sd(x), 
               fun.ymax = function(x) mean(x) + sd(x), 
               geom = "pointrange") +
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean,
               geom = "line") +
  facet_wrap( ~  rural_urban) +
  labs(title = "Dosage Change - Density Normalization")+
  theme_minimal()



ggarrange(p5, p6, ncol= 2 )

```


## t-test

http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/unpaired-two-samples-t-test-in-r

```{r}
t.test(DOSAGE_UNIT ~ rural_urban, data = Annual, var.equal = TRUE)

t.test(dens_DOSAGE ~ rural_urban, data = Annual, var.equal = TRUE)

```

We can see that the result is different depending on how we normalize the data!

# **Summary**

## Summary Plot

## Synopsis

In this case study we have demonstrated the basics of R Markdown and how to create a dashboard with using the `flexdashboard` package. We also demonstrated how to include an interactive table with the `DT` package, how to include interactive plots using functions of the `shiny` package such as `renderPlot()`. We also included interactive value boxes using the `renderValueBox()` function of the `flexdashboard` package which works with the `shiny` package. Finally we also showed how to include interactive maps using the `leaflet` package. 

This case study also explored how to properly calculate and interpret percentages when the data has missing values. We also discussed the benefits and limiting aspects of pie charts (using `ggplot2`) and waffle plots (using `waffle`).

Overall the dashboard that we created shows that the number of shootings per year has increased overtime. Further investigation is necessary to determine if this is simply due to increases in population alone or if the rate has increased due to other factors and if so, what those factors might be. It is also clear that the number of shootings and the number of deaths per capita varies by state. Thus there appears to be other aspects accounting for state differences. 

# **Suggested Homework**
*** 

Create another dashboard with graphs and statistics featuring other elements within this dataset. For example, students may create graphs that explore what school events are reported to have more shootings.

If you or a loved one is stuggling with opioid addiction, contact the SAMHSA’s National Helpline at [1-800-662-HELP (4357)](tel:1-800-662-HELP (4357)). 

It is a free, confidential, 24/7, 365-day-a-year treatment referral and information service (in English and Spanish) for individuals and families facing mental and/or substance use disorders.

You can also contact the [Addiction Center](https://www.addictioncenter.com/drugs/overdose/) at [(877)871-3575](tel:877871-3575) which also has a confidential 24/7 live chat at:
[https://www.addictioncenter.com/drugs/overdose/](https://www.addictioncenter.com/drugs/overdose/).

According to their website:

>Remember, that being able to treat an overdose at home is not a replacement for a hospital. Even if the moment has passed, and the victim seems fine, there is still a chance that something is going on that cannot be seen by the human eye. Taking the victim to the hospital, can mean the difference between life and death.

> Overdose is a scary word. We often associate it with death, but the two are not always connected. Life can go on after an overdose, but only if the person suffering understands and learns from it. Getting on the road to recovery is not easily done but it is always possible, and the only guaranteed way to never suffer an overdose again. If you don’t know where this path begins, or need help getting help for a loved one, please reach out to a dedicated treatment provider. They’re here, 24/7, to answer any questions you may have. Be it for yourself or someone else.

According to [harmreduction.org](https://harmreduction.org/issues/overdose-prevention/overview/overdose-basics/recognizing-opioid-overdose/), the following are signs of an overdose:

- Loss of consciousness
-Unresponsive to outside stimulus
- Awake, but unable to talk
- Breathing is very slow and shallow, erratic, or has stopped
- For lighter skinned people, the skin tone turns bluish purple, for darker skinned people, it turns grayish or ashen.
- Choking sounds, or a snore-like gurgling noise (sometimes called the “death rattle”)
- Vomiting
- Body is very limp
- Face is very pale or clammy
- Fingernails and lips turn blue or purplish black
- Pulse (heartbeat) is slow, erratic, or not there at all
 
If someone is making unfamiliar sounds while “sleeping” it is worth trying to wake him or her up. Many loved ones of users think a person was snoring, when in fact the person was overdosing. These situations are a missed opportunity to intervene and save a life.

Sometimes it can be difficult to tell if a person is just very high, or experiencing an overdose.  If you’re having a hard time telling the difference, it is best to treat the situation like an overdose – it could save someone’s life.

**The most important thing is to act right away!**
