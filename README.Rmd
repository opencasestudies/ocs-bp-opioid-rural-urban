### Title 

Fifty Years of School Shootings in the United States

### Motivation 

According to this [report](https://siepr.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/19-036.pdf) school shootings can have long lasting impacts on those that witness them. This article states that:

> Over **240,000** American students experienced a school shooting in the last two decades.

Therefore as the number of school shootings apppears to be increasing, it is useful to better understand the characteristics about these shootings to better understand why they happen and how to avoid them in the future.


### Motivating questions

<b><u> Our main questions: </u></b>

1) What has been the yearly rate of school shootings and where have they occurred in the last 50 years (from January 1970 to June 2020)? 

2) What are the characteristics of these events?

### Data

In this case study we will be using data related to school shootings in the US from 1970 to June 2020 from the [**Center for Homeland Defense and Security (CHDS)**](Center for Homeland Defense and Security (CHDS)) [**K-12 Shool Shooting Database**](https://www.chds.us/ssdb/dataset/). 

Their methods for identifying and authenticating incidents are outlined [here](https://www.chds.us/ssdb/methods/).

According to their website: 

*"The database compiles information from more than 25 different sources including peer-reviewed studies, government reports, mainstream media, non-profits, private websites, blogs, and crowd-sourced lists that have been analyzed, filtered, deconflicted, and cross-referenced. **All of the information is based on open-source information and 3rd party reporting... and may include reporting errors.**"*

#### Learning Objectives

The skills, methods, and concepts that students will be familiar with by the end of this case study are:


Data science skills:  
  
1. Importing text from a Google Sheets document (`googlesheets4`)  
2. Converting date formats (`lubridate`)  
3. Geocoding data (`ggmap`)  and creating a jitter for geocoded data on a map (`SF`)
4. How to reshape data by pivoting between "long" and "wide" formats and drop rows with `NA` values (`tidyr`)  
5. How to create data visualizations with `ggplot2` 
6. An introductory understand of R Markdown  
7. How to create an interactive table (`DT`)  
8. How to create a map (`leaflet`)  
9. How to create an interactive dashboard with `flexdashboard` and `shiny`  

Statistical concepts and methods:  
  
1. Calculating percentages for data with missing values  

#### Data import 

In this case study we demonstrate how to import data from Google Sheets, however we have also downloaded the data as a CSV file and we demonstate how to import the data in this format as well. 

#### Data wrangling 

This case study covers the differences between the various `*_join()` functions of the `dplyr` package, as well as use of the `case_when()` function to recode data based on particular evaluations of existing values.

We also cover removing `NA` values with the `drop_na()` function of the `tidyr` package, and selecting the last few variables of a tibble using the `last_col()` function. We  cover using the `tidyr` functions such as `pivot_wider()` and `pivot_longer()` for reshaping data, as well as arranging levels of factors using the `forcats` package. 

Finally, this case study also covers a few of the `stringr` functions to manipulate character strings, including `str_c()`, `str_detect()`, and `str_remove()` as well as some of the functions of teh `lubridate` package for working with data related to dates.

We also cover how to geocode data using the `ggmap` package and how to modify duplicated locations using the `SF` pacakge so as to avoid overlapping points on a map.

#### Data Visualization

In this case study we show how to make faceted plots where each plot has its own y-axis label (which is actually a bit tricky), we show how to make pie charts with `ggplot2` and we demonstrate how to use the `waffle` package to create a waffle plot. We also discuss why in some cases a pie chart might not be a good choice. 

We also show how to create an interactive table with the `DT` package, as well as how to create an interactive map with the `leaflet` package.

### Analysis 

This case study does not really include an analysis like other case studies, but it does domonstrate how to create simple percentage statistics using a data with missing values, as well as how to properly report such percentages.

#### For users 

There is a [`Makefile`](Makefile) in this folder that allows you to type `make` to knit the case study contained in the `index.Rmd` to `index.html` and it will also knit the [`README.Rmd`](README.Rmd) to a markdown file (`README.md`). 

Users can skip the Data Import and Data Wrangling sections to start with the Data Analysis and Visualization section if they wish. 

#### For instructors

Instructors who only wish to demonstrate the basics of how to create a dashboard with `flexdashboard` can simply use the `Dashboard Basics` section, this would likely only take one or two class sessions to cover.

Instructors can skip the Data Import and Data Wrangling sections to start with the Data Analysis section if they wish. 


#### Target audience 

This case study is appropriate for those new to R programming. It is also appropriate for more advanced R users who are new to the Tidyverse. This particular case study may require some introductory knowlege of R programming. 

#### Suggested homework

Create another dashboard with graphs and statistics featuring other elements within this dataset. For example, students may create graphs that explore what school events are reported to have more shootings. Students could be asked to use one of the pages of the dashboard that we created as an example.
